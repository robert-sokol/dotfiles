# dotfiles

This is my personal repository for managing config files.

## Usage

Clone the repository to .cfg/ directory in your home, with:

`git clone https://github.com/robert-sokol/dotfiles.git "$HOME"/.cfg`,
and run `install-conf.sh` . The script will create backups of the current configs in "$HOME/.config-backup/", and move all dotfiles to the proper locations in your "$HOME".
